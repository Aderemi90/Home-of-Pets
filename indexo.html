        <h2> Introduction </h2>
        <p class="essay">Pets have been apart of humans lives for centuries. Dogs have been known as a “man 's best
            friend” for good reason. Cats and dogs are among the most popular types of pets in the United States. *They
            both make great house pets, but dogs make better house pets than cats for all ages. Dogs are better for
            playing with, adapting to new environments, and are better protectors than cats.
            Dogs enjoy to be played with more than cats. Although cats enjoy to be played with at times; cats are much
            more nonchalant and antisocial. Cats enjoy sleeping and roaming on their own free will, and are much less
            attracted to playing with their owner. Especially as they get older, cats would not make a good pet for
            kids. On the other hand; a dog's favorite thing to do is to play with its owner, and this is primarily why

            be loud enough to either scare the intruder away or to wake the owner. Cats are far more likely to avoid any
            kind of danger coming their way, and most likely would not help ward off any unwanted threats. Dogs, on the
            other hand, can grow to be much larger than cats. Dogs are much more alert, and will bark or growl at
            anything they might see as a threat on the outside of the house. Even the smaller breeds of dogs, despite
            their size, are very alert to anything outside the home. can also be trained as guard dogs, and listen very
            keenly to any command the owner has for the dog. While possessing both control and size, a dog can be an
